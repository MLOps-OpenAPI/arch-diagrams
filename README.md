## Required Fields

For each use case there are a set of inputs that are needed to run the event. By default - for documentation simplicity - we assume that all fields are required. When there is a mix of required and optional fields, the required fields will be specifically identified by the following symbol: `*`.

## Personas

Below is a common set of persona definitions that can be used to build out the API specification.

#### MLOps Engineers

    Build and manage deployment pipelines, CI/CD, and monitoring for ML models, ensuring automation and scalability across the model lifecycle.

#### Data Scientists

    Create value from complex data through statistical analysis and machine learning, rigorously evaluating model performance against business requirements, and iteratively improving solutions to ensure both technical excellence and real-world impact.

#### Data Engineers

    Construct and maintain data pipelines, ETL processes, and data architectures to support model development and operational workflows.

#### Platform Engineers

    Manage infrastructure for compute, storage, and serving environments to ensure stability, availability, and scalability for model training and deployment.

#### IT Operations

    Oversee IT infrastructure and network security to support MLOps processes and maintain reliable, secure operations.

#### AI Engineers / Intelligent App Developers

    Integrate and optimize machine learning models within applications, focusing on quality, performance, user functionality, and bridging AI with end-user needs.

#### Business & Strategy Leaders

    Define AI priorities and align projects with business goals, focusing on strategic impact and return on investment.

#### Security & Compliance Officers
